# Kotlin Mobile Capstone Project

This repository contains the source code for the mobile version of my capstone project — an Android application developed using **Kotlin** and the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture.

---

## Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM Architecture**, separating the UI, business logic, and data handling layers:
- **Model** – Handles data sources and logic
- **View** – XML layouts and Activity/Fragment for user interface
- **ViewModel** – Manages UI-related data using LiveData and interacts with the Model

---

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin** – Primary programming language  
- **MVVM Architecture** – For modular and testable code  
- **LiveData** – For observable data binding  
- **ViewModel** – For lifecycle-aware state management  
- **Retrofit** – For API communication  
- **Data Binding** – For connecting UI components to data sources

---

## Features

- Clean and maintainable project structure
- Dynamic UI updates through LiveData
- Separation of concerns with MVVM
